            <div class="about_text">
                The club started in June 1969 with the first meeting at the Northampton Liberal Club where around fifteen potential members attended, and in December that year we became official placed on the National Club & Societies list.<br><br>

Our first show was held at the Racecourse Pavilion on Kettering Road which was quite successful, and since then we have held a show most years.<br><br>

We have moved serval times, initial moving to St Micheals Road where we shared a room with Northampton Modellers, then to Kingsthorpe Park Hall followed by Hardingstone Village Hall. And in early 2025 me move again to our current location of Roade Village Hall, where we continue to meet weekly and hold our show.<br>
                
                <!--The club started in June 1969 with the first meeting at the Northampton Liberal Club
                 Northampton and District model railway club was founded in 1969 and has had several homes over the years.

Kingsthorpe hall Was the home of the club for many years and the club had sole use of the top floor of the building which allowed them to leave any projects that were ongoing until the following week rather than put the project away as we have to do, even today.

As the club room was on the top floor of a building that had a spiral staircase it created problems when we had to move model railway layouts in and out of the building usually when we were attending model railway shows with the layouts.

This venue was used by the railway club until the time that there was a Radon gas scare, and we were asked to vacate the building due to the health implications. We then struggled to find a new home for the club and resorted to meeting in a local pub which was really not ideal.

Luckily my son was a member of the local boys brigade and the man in charge helped us out by letting us use the boys brigade hall one night per week.

The hall was large enough for the layouts but storage was a problem so we were always hopeful that we could find a better venue locally for the club.

We were then informed that there was a council owned community hall available in Hunsbury which was suitable for us.
 As before the hall was suitable for the layouts but again we had very limited storage and had to put away everything after an evening running trains which was not ideal.

We were then offered to return to Kingsthorpe as the Hall had been refurbished and the stable block had been developed into Kingsthorpe Community Centre. We took the opportunity to move back there even though it was similar to the Hunsbury Hill venue and also the parking was quite difficult. 

We continued to use the Kingsthorpe Community Centre for a few years but the parking problems remained difficult for members who had to wait until the previous club  group members had removed their cars from the car park.

Our club secretary went on our local radio station and asked if anybody had a suitable hall available for us to use and the Hardingstone Village hall committee answered our plea and we then moved to their hall which had a much larger car park. However we had to construct a new shed to store our model railway equipment in as we  still did not have sole use of the hall.

This now brings us up to date as we found a new venue at Roade village hall where we are currently based. This new venue is larger than the one we had at Harding stone and the car park is substantial. We have use of the garage on site to store our layouts and a purpose built metal shed to store other items. We are lucky enough to be able to hold our annual model railway show at the same venue which solves a lot of the transport problems we had before, as the previous sites were not large enough.

                On a normal week we get 3 running layouts out which are the Demonstration layout, the Junior OO Gauge

                We currently also get out the then new Junior Display layout (Rheilffordd Nant‐Y‐Clag) and the new N
                gauge Display Layout (RAYBILL JUNCTION). These layouts are currently being worked on for our show on
                July 19th, with wirring being complete and scenery being worked on currently.

                The layout is a scale model of Northampton's Castle Station in the 1930s. It shows the area between
                Westbridge and Spencer Bridge and features buildings that were replaced in 1965. To mark its 50th
                anniversary, the Northampton &amp District Model Railway Club has built a layout of the town's Victorian
                Castle Station, which was lovingly recreated by local railway enthusiast, Leslie Roy.
