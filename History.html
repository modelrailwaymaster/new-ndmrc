        <div class="history_title center">Our History By Les:</div>
        <div class="history_text center">
            Northampton and District model railway club was founded in 1969 and has had several homes over the years.

            Kingsthorpe hall Was the home of the club for many years and the club had sole use of the top floor of the building which allowed them to leave any projects that were ongoing until the following week rather than put the project away as we have to do, even today. As the club room was on the top floor of a building that had a spiral staircase it created problems when we had to move model railway layouts in and out of the building usually when we were attending model railway shows with the layouts. This venue was used by the railway club until the time that there was a Radon gas scare, and we were asked to vacate the building due to the health implications. We then struggled to find a new home for the club and resorted to meeting in a local pub which was really not ideal.

            Luckily my son was a member of the local boys brigade and the man in charge helped us out by letting us use the boys brigade hall one night per week. The hall was large enough for the layouts but storage was a problem so we were always hopeful that we could find a better venue locally for the club.

            We were then informed that there was a council owned community hall available in Hunsbury which was suitable for us. As before the hall was suitable for the layouts but again we had very limited storage and had to put away everything after an evening running trains which was not ideal.

            We were then offered to return to Kingsthorpe as the Hall had been refurbished and the stable block had been developed into Kingsthorpe Community Centre. We took the opportunity to move back there even though it was similar to the Hunsbury Hill venue and also the parking was quite difficult.  We continued to use the Kingsthorpe Community Centre for a few years but the parking problems remained difficult for members who had to wait until the previous club group members had removed their cars from the car park.

            Our club secretary went on our local radio station and asked if anybody had a suitable hall available for us to use and the Hardingstone Village hall committee answered our plea and we then moved to their hall which had a much larger car park. However we had to construct a new shed to store our model railway equipment in as we still did not have sole use of the hall.

            This now brings us up to date as we found a new venue at Roade village hall where we are currently based. This new venue is larger than the one we had at Harding stone and the car park is substantial. We have use of the garage on site to store our layouts and a purpose built metal shed to store other items. We are lucky enough to be able to hold our annual model railway show at the same venue which solves a lot of the transport problems we had before, as the previous sites were not large enough.
