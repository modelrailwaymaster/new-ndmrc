                The layout is a scale model of Northampton's Castle Station in the 1930s. It shows the area between
                Westbridge and Spencer Bridge and features buildings that were replaced in 1965. What makes the model
                special is the quality of the modelling and the attention to detail. Leslie studied art and was an avid
                railway photographer in the 1950s and '60s. As well as researching the station history, his model is
                based on photographs and actual measurements of buildings that he took before its demolition in 1965.
                <br><br>
                To mark its 50th anniversary, the Northampton &amp District Model Railway Club has built a layout of the
                town's Victorian Castle Station, which was lovingly recreated by local railway enthusiast, Leslie Roy.
                <br><br>
                Leslie started work on his scale model of Castle Station in the loft of his Northampton home in the
                1980s. His son, Timothy, donated the model to the club following his father's death in June 2016. The
                model was designed as a permanent layout in Leslie's home, but the club has modified it to create a
                portable layout that can be used at club meetings and displayed at shows and exhibitions. Although the
                Club could not utilize the original baseboards or track that Leslie built, we have used all the
                buildings that he scratch built.

        <div class="layout_history">
            <div class="layout_history_title center">A brief history of Castle Station:</div>
            <br>
            On the 30 December 1830 a meeting took place at the White Horse Inn in Towcester.
            <br><br>
            Those attending included some of Northampton's landed gentry and clergy who vehemently opposed the idea
            of a railway, led by the influential Duke of Grafton. The meeting passed three resolutions, which stated
            in effect that the said railway would do great harm to their estates, and in any case, the daily coaches
            and canals provided more than adequate means of transport. Initially, there was also a measure of
            opposition in the town of Northampton, but this quickly evaporated.
            <br><br>
            Robert Stephenson, the engineer in charge of the proposed London to Birmingham railway line, wished to
            avoid parks and pleasure grounds, and was concerned that the line through Northampton would also pass
            close to the Althorpe Estate, the seat of Earl Spencer, whose son was then Chancellor of the Exchequer.
            He was also aware that a route via Northampton would involve steep gradients because of the Nene Valley,
            and the inadequate locomotives then available might not have been able to cope with the inclines.
            <br><br>
            So, there were sound political and geographical reasons why the route should by-pass the town. He
            therefore recommended a line four and a half miles to the west.
            <br><br>
            Despite the attitude of hostile landowners in February 1832, The London and Birmingham Railway (LBR)
            sought parliamentary approval for their line, but the bill was defeated and the company had to rethink
            the scheme again. They resolved to persuade their opponents that their fears were unfounded and offered
            generous compensation.
            <br><br>
            They eventually won the grudging support of their critics and the bill received Royal assent in May
            1833. Stephenson's route was approved and Northampton was destined to be served by a short branch line
            from Blisworth, this opening in May 1845.
            <br><br>
            Some years later, there was considerable agitation in Northampton for an improved railway connection,
            and in 1859 a public meeting in the town chaired by the Mayor, demanded faster through trains to London.
            So in 1875 the LNWR, successors to the LBR, obtained powers to quadruple the existing main line
            northwards from Bletchley.
            <br><br>
            It was proposed that the two new tracks would diverge from the main line just north of Roade and
            continue to Rugby via Northampton and the Althorpe valley.
            <br><br>
            The new line joined the Market Harborough branch at Castle Station in Northampton by means of a very
            tight curve and diverged at Kingsthorpe. Castle Station was rebuilt; the river was diverted for half a
            mile, while the castle ruins were demolished to make room for the goods shed!
            <br><br>
            The route opened throughout on the 3 of April 1882, and at long last Northampton obtained a decent main
            line service.
            <br><br>
            The original main line threaded a 1.5 mile long 65-foot deep cutting north of Roade. It is said that
            over one million cubic yards of spoil were removed by navies, retaining walls more than two feet thick
            were required.
            <br><br>
            In 1875 the LNWR deepened the cutting to accommodate the new line and lengthened the retaining walls,
            but there was a bad land slip in November 1891 following heavy rain, so iron girders were then placed
            across the Northampton line to hold back the walls and prevent a recurrence. This structure was given
            the suitable nickname of The Birdcage.
