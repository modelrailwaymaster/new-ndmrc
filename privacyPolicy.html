                related social media channels.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You have the right to withdraw your consent to these activities at any time, which will mean (unless another
            lawful basis applies to your data) that we will cease to process the affected data after consent is
            withdrawn. However, please note this may result in us being unable to provide you with certain features of
            the website and/or services. The primary purpose for which we collect information about you is to provide
            you with services you have requested from us. We also collect information about you for the following

            <li>For the administration of NDMRC membership records.</li>

                efficient and reliable Service</li>
            <li>Making important communications about your involvement</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>To help identify/prevent fraudulent activity</li>
            <li>To comply with our legal obligations (including under applicable data protection laws)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>If you fail to provide personal data</strong></p>
        <p>You are not generally required to provide to us any personal data. Where you choose to do so (through email
            or online form submissions) we shall assume that you have done so willingly in the full knowledge of our
            policy. Bear in mind that we may be unable to respond to any requests for information or membership
            acceptance if you decline to provide us with adequate information.</p>
        <p><strong>Who do we share your information with?</strong></p>
        <p>Your personal data is primarily only used within NDMRC. However, in certain limited circumstances we may
            share your information with other third parties particularly where it is required by law. These could
            include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Other organisation supporting us in the delivery of services or information to you; payment portals,
                marketing, IT and event management services.</li>
            <li>Where you have expressed an interest in receiving information about its activities</li>
            <li>Third parties: we may be required to disclose such personal data in order to comply with our legal
                obligations or enforce our legal rights, e.g. any relevant authority or enforcement body and fraud
                protection</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Sensitive Personal Data.&nbsp;</strong>We do not collect any Special Categories of Personal Data
            about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life,
            sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health and genetic
            and biometric data). Nor do we collect any information about criminal convictions and offences.</p>
        <p><strong>Retention of Personal Data.</strong></p>
        <p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for,
            including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
        <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and
            sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your
            personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those
            purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
        <p><strong>Data Subject’s Rights.&nbsp;</strong>In certain circumstances you have rights under data protection
            laws in relation to the personal data we hold about you. These are summarised below:</p>
        <p>Right of Access. You are entitled to ask for access to your personal data so that you are aware of and can
            verify the lawfulness of the processing. This is achieved through the mechanism, of a Subject Access Request
            (SAR) and you have the right to obtain:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Confirmation that your data is being processed (held)</li>
            <li>Access to your personal data (copy) and</li>
            <li>Other supplementary information that corresponds to the information&nbsp;in this Privacy Notice</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This information will be provided without charge, without delay and within one month. If an extension is
            required or requests are considered manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because they are
            repetitive, NDMRC may:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>choose to charge a reasonable fee, taking into account the administrative costs of providing the
                information or</li>
            <li>refuse to respond. The reasons will be formally notified to you and your rights of appeal to the
                appropriate Supervisory Authority i.e. UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) will be highlighted.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Identity Verification.</strong> To protect your personal data, NDMRC will seek to verify your
            identity before releasing any information, which will normally be in electronic format. This will normally
            be a simple process.</p>
        <p><strong>Right of Rectification.</strong> You are entitled to have personal data rectified or corrected if it
            is inaccurate or incomplete. NDMRC will respond within one month of your request.</p>
        <p><strong>Right of Erasure.</strong> You may request the deletion or removal of personal data where there is no
            compelling reason for its continued processing. The Right to Erasure does not provide an
            absolute&nbsp;‘right to be forgotten’.&nbsp;However, you do have a right to have personal data erased and to
            prevent processing in specific circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Where the personal data is no longer necessary in relation to the purpose for which it was originally
                collected/processed</li>
            <li>When you withdraw consent</li>
            <li>When you object to the processing and there is no overriding legitimate reason for continuing the
                processing</li>
            <li>Personal data was unlawfully processed</li>
            <li>Personal data has to be erased in order to comply with a legal obligation</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Right to Restrict Processing.</strong> Under the Act, you have a right to&nbsp;‘block’&nbsp;or
            suppress processing of personal data. The restriction of processing under GDPR is similar. When processing
            is restricted, NDMRC is permitted to store the personal data, but not process it further. In this event,
            exactly what is held and why will be explained to you.</p>
        <p><strong>Right to Data Portability.</strong> You may ask to obtain and reuse your personal data for your own
            purposes across different services. This allows you to move, copy or transfer personal data easily from one
            IT environment to another in a safe and secure way, without hindrance to usability. The Right to Data
            Portability only applies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To personal data you have supplied to NDMRC</li>
            <li>Where the processing is based upon your consent or for the performance of a contract and</li>
            <li>When processing is carried out by automated means</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In these circumstances, NDMRC will provide you with a copy of your data free of charge, without delay and
            within one month. If there is going to be a delay you will be informed.</p>
        <p><strong>Right to Object.</strong> You have the right to object to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Processing based on legitimate interests or the performance of a task in the public interest/exercise of
                official authority (including profiling)</li>
            <li>Direct marketing (including profiling) and</li>
            <li>Processing for purposes of scientific/historical research and statistics</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Security of your data</strong></p>
        <p>We treat the security of your data seriously. We make every effort to prevent your personal data from being
            accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit
            access to your personal data to those persons who have a legitimate need to know for the purpose of
            fulfilling your requests or providing you with information.</p>
        <p><strong>Third party links on our site</strong></p>
